PROBLEMS
========
On master branch, tag1.0 has all test passed. It use a not good solution on login feature.
On another_login_solution branch, tag2.0 has unpassed test(feature is worked). But it use a more better solution on login feature.
Why ?

TODO
====
Each Single Test(start from it or feature) should restart sockets data(Really Need?)
Stop Add more feature and take a more deep research on socket.io and how test of socket.io
